        Consider if you're looking to get help with something, or whether you think there's a bug with this project itself. If it's the former, we'd love to help you - but the best way to do that is through [asking for help](https://discord.vuestorefront.io) rather than reporting a bug.

        Please create a minimal reproduction
        ðŸ‘‰ If possible, link to a reproduction repository. 
        ðŸ‘‰ Otherwise, write a step-by-step guide of how we can reproduce the issue

      description: Please provide a link to a repo that can reproduce the problem you ran into. A **minimal reproduction** is required unless you are absolutely sure that the issue is obvious and the provided information is enough to understand the problem. If a report is vague (e.g. just a generic error message) and has no reproduction, it will receive a "need reproduction" label. If no reproduction is provided we might close it.
